# CubeScrambler
Gonna generate some good 3x3x3 cube scrambles for practice.

# When am I gonna start working on this project?
I'll probably start working on this project after 20th March 2022. THe progress will be quite slow though because of studies.

# Plans
* Get the colour for the 1st layer = x
* None of x's edges must be directly connected to x's centre.
* None of x's edges must be directly connected to its other colours centre.
* None of x's edges must be directly connected to the centre of the colour opposite to the other colour of the edge.
* A lot of other checks
* ...
* Generate a list of scrambles.
* Save them in a file.
* Print a random scramble from the list.
* Ask for the rating of the scramble.
* Save the rating for a potential machine learning addaptation of the project.
